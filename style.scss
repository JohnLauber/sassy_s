Description: Hi. I'm a starter theme called <code>_s</code>, or <em>underscores</em>, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a <em>Parent Theme</em>. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

// Some common variables and mixins to get you started.
// Variables allow you to re-use colors, sizes, and other values without repeating
// yourself. This means that changes that should be small, such as tweaking the
// coloring or the sizing, can be done in one place, not all over the stylesheet.

$base-font: sans-serif;
$header-font: $base-font; // you can refer to other variables

// Mixins are usually bigger than just one value. They can also accept parameters.
// Use them like so: selector {@include mixin();}, or see the _globals file for examples!

    &:before, &:after {
